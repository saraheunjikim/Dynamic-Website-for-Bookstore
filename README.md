## The Process and What I have learned

### The Process
<p>
  This was a part of my final project for my class, where I needed to use HTML/CSS and PHP to
  create a dynamic website where I retrieve all book information from the database in MySQL.
</p>

<p>
  This was my first time working with a server-side script language, PHP,
  and it was a great experience that I learned the differences between client-side and server-side.
</p>

### Lesson Learned
<p>
  Completing this project, I learned how a database could be connected to a website. I'd always wanted to know about implementing a database on a website, and I was excited to learn about it. 
</p>
<p>
One of the challenges had a perfect CSS for the web interface. I mostly used Bootstrap4, so I didn't need to work a lot with CSS, but for this project, I only had to use CSS, so I spent quite some time position items aligned. 
</p>
<p>
Another challenge was to write good validation rules using PHP. Although I could use simple validation rules in HTML, I learned it is more secure validating on the server-side, so I spent a good time figuring different rules using REGEX.
</p>
<p>
In this project, to connect to the database, I used mysqli than PDO. However, I learned that PDO might be a better option as it can also use different databases other than MySQL. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I learned always to use prepared statements instead of statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. Honestly, I previously never worried about any attacks on the website because I had a mindset of "who would care about my project?". However, I need to practice excellent security practices all the time, no matter what kind of projects I'm working on because any project's security matters. So every project, I plan to learn and study more about information security and how I can implement those in my project.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I enjoyed this project a lot, and I'd love to start another project with PHP and MySQL again!
